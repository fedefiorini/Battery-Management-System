# Documentation and Useful Links

This folder contains the documentation for all the most important components in the BMS repository and, hopefully, can help debugging the code and changing it to apply for different use-cases.
**IMPORTANT**: You need an NXP account to access some of the documentation. For some documents, please refer to the PDFs included in this section (for a quicker troubleshooting).

Unfortunately, no hardware description is given, as it belongs to the respective hardware engineers from the Formula Student Team, and I wasn't given permission to share these details.
